# Route Issue Diagnosis

## Problem
The admin routes are not working properly. When accessing `http://localhost:3000/control-panel/login`, we get a "404 Page Not Found" error.

## What We Know
1. The `dist/public` directory exists and contains the built React app
2. The `index.html` file exists and is valid
3. The server is using ES modules (import/export syntax)
4. The server configuration in `server-supabase.js` appears to be correct
5. The routes are defined in the server file

## Possible Issues
1. **Route Order**: Static file middleware might be interfering with route matching
2. **Path Resolution**: File paths might not be resolving correctly
3. **Server Startup**: The server might not be starting properly
4. **Middleware Conflicts**: Session middleware or other middleware might be causing issues

## Diagnostic Steps Taken
1. Created multiple test servers to isolate the issue
2. Verified that static files exist and are accessible
3. Checked route definitions in the main server file
4. Created minimal test cases to verify basic functionality

## Solution Approach
Let's create a completely clean server implementation that focuses only on the routing issue:

1. Simplify the route order
2. Add extensive logging
3. Ensure proper error handling
4. Test with a minimal configuration

## Files Created for Testing
1. `minimal-test.js` - Basic server test
2. `server-start-test.js` - Server startup test
3. `server-import-test.js` - Import testing
4. `route-debug.js` - Route debugging with extensive logging

## Next Steps
1. Run the `route-debug.js` script to see if basic routing works
2. If that works, compare the configuration with the main server
3. Identify the specific difference causing the issue
4. Apply the fix to the main server file

## Expected Outcome
By isolating the routing issue in a minimal environment, we should be able to identify exactly what's causing the 404 error and fix it in the main server implementation.
